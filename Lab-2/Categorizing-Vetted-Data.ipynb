    "### In this notebook, we will explore machine learning using Spark ML. We will exploit Spark ML's high-level APIs built on top of DataFrames to create and tune machine learning pipelines. Spark ML Pipelines enable combining multiple algorithms into a single pipeline or workflow. We will utilize Spark ML's feature transformers to convert, modify and scale the features that will be used to develop the machine learning model. Finally, we will evaluate and cross validate our model to demonstrate the process of determining a best fit model and load the results in the database.\n",
