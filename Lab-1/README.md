In this lab, you will use IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX) to create a Jupyter IPython notebook to connect to and query a DB2 Warehouse instance running in IBM Bluemix.

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Create a Jupyter IPython notebook from a URL
1. Establish a connection to DB2 Warehouse on Cloud
1. Use a dataframe to read and manipulate tables
1. Use SQL to query the database
1. Explore the data using techniques from earlier in the lab
1. Close the database connection

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Log into your [DSX](http://datascience.ibm.com/) account, then click Projects in the top menu bar then select the project you created at the beginning of this proof of technology.

1. Click the `From URL` tab under `Create Notebook`.
1. Give the notebook a name in the `Name` field, for example `Connect and Interact with DB2 Warehouse` and optionally you can give it a description.
1. In the Notebook URL field, use `https://github.com/jpatter/GEOINT/blob/master/Lab-1/databaseConnectAndInteract.ipynb`.
1. Ensure that there is a `Spark Service` selected from the dropdown list, then click the `Create Notebook` button on the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 4.  Follow the instructions in the notebook.
