## Instructions:
For Lab 4, there is a choice of two labs. Both labs will use passenger data from the Titanic. This is a common data set
used in Kaggle competitions. Please choose one of the following labs. The description of each lab and a pointer to the instructions are documented below. 

1. Watson Machine Learning lab  
2. DSX SPSS Modeler Lab


## Watson Machine Learning Lab (4a)

## Introduction:

In this lab, you will use IBM's Watson Machine Learning GUI to train, evaluate, and deploy a Watson Machine Learning model based on the Titanic dataset.  

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the Watson Machine Learning GUI.  
2. Train/Evaluate a machine learning model
3. Deploy a machine learning model. 
4. Deploy an application that invokes the machine learning model service.

## DSX SPSS Modeler Lab (4b)

## Introduction: 

In this lab, you will use the Data Science Experience SPSS Modeler capability to explore, prepare, and model passenger data from the Titanic. The SPSS Modeler is a drag and drop capability to build machine learning pipelines. 

## Objectives: 

Upon completing the lab, you will:

1. Become familiar with the DSX SPSS Modeler capability
2. Profile the Titanic data set 
3. Explore the Titanic data set with visualizations
4. Cleanse and Transform the data 
5. Train/Evaluate a machine learning mode.
