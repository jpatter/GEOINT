Use IBMâ€™s Watson Studio and IBM Cloud services to create a working cloud-based application from start to finish.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs that build upon one another so it is important that they are completed in order. A fourth lab will explore additional features of Watson Studio. 

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will begin with loading raw delimited data into DB2 Warehouse for Cloud and interacting with that data from a Jupyter notebook in Watson Studio with python.

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will leverage Spark machine learning (SparkML) on the loaded data to create categorical predictions using pyspark and a supervised learning model and store the results back to the database.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The third lab will guide participants in creating an R notebook and Shiny UI in Watson Studio using RStudio.

1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) - Time permitting there will be two labs to choose from for Lab 4. The first one features Watson Machine Learning, a point and click capability to build a machine learning model and deploy it. The second lab features SPSS - a visual programming tool to create a machine learning pipeline.
